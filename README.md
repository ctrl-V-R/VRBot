# VRBot
Discord Bot in Python (USING discord.py)

VRBot is still under-dev and will continue to be so as long as I have time to work on it :p

The token for the bot has been replaced by an asterisk, so if you are interested in downloading the bot and customizing it yourself you need to create a bot yourself
and use your own token.
You can get your token by becoming a discord app dev here: https://discord.com/developers/applications

!!Keep in mind that the discord.py library is constantly changing so be sure to keep up to date with the libraries since I may or may not keep updating this bot
